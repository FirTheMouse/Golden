Installation instructions:

Ensure you have CMake installed and C++ setup with a compiler.
[PUT INSTRUCTIONS OR LINK TO GUIDE FOR THIS LATER]

Run:
cmake -S . -B build
Then:
cmake –build build

In order to run:
cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build && ./build/bin/GPM
Or if on Windows:
cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build && ./build/bin/GPM.exe

This will launch the Golden Project Manager, which lets you create and launch projects.
In order to use the GPM, navigate to the GPM project, and in the main method set the different slots (p1, p2, etc…) to the project name you want to launch. Then press that number on your keyboard with the GPM launched to run it.
